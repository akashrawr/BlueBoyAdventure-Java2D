## Game Mechanics

<h3> Guard </h3>

- Reduce incoming damage by half when you block!

<h3> Parry </h3>

- Timing is key! If you block within 200 milliseconds of a monster's attack, you perform a parry, gaining a critical hit chance for 1 second. Critical hits deal double damage.

<h3> Ninja </h3>

- Slice through projectiles with precision timing using your weapon.

<h3> Survivor </h3>

- Some trees and walls are destructible. Use the right weapon for the task!

<h3> Pool </h3>

- Recover health/mana and save your progress, but beware: monsters will respawn.

<h3> Coin </h3>

- Collect coins and trade with the merchant to upgrade your equipment.

<h3> Tent </h3>

- Rest until the next day to restore your energy.

<h3> Lantern </h3>

- When night falls, your lantern becomes essential for visibility.
